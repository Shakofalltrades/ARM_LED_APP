# LUMNET - Server Code (ARM Wireless Mesh LEDs Project)
### Third-year Group Project
This project deploys a mesh network (PainlessMesh) to connect nodes of Addressable LEDs to display animations across them in sync. A separate repository can be found [here]([https://github.com/Shakofalltrades/ARM_LED_APP](https://github.com/pb1n/LEDMeshProject) for the set up of the nodes and border-router.
